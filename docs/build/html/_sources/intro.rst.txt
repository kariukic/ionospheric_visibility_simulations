Introduction
============

Sivio is Radio Astronomy Python package which provides simulations of radio  telescope observation data as it would be when affected by ionospheric refraction. 

It approximates the ionosphere as a thin phase screen at a user specified height and different levels of ionospheric turbulence and structures can be generated.

It can also be used to simulate model sky visibilities and provides analysis functionalities between model and contaminated data.

Motivation
**********
To isolate ionospheric effects in radio data for further analysis in specific science cases.

Limitations
***********

- Currently works well for the MWA Telescope. For other telescopes it might need one or two tweaks but it should work without much hustle.
